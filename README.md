## Oi ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Tiago, a reservoir engineer at Petrobras.

I'm also pursuing a Ph.D. in Petroleum Engineering at Unicamp, where my research focuses on integrating machine learning techniques to address _some_ of the everyday challenges faced by reservoir engineers.

Currently, I'm exploring the potential of neural networks to partially replace traditional full porous-media numerical simulations in multi-run scenarios, aiming to reduce the number of required simulation runs.
